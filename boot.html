            <b>This was my reading response to Bardini's Bootstrap:</b>
            <br>
            I came into this chapter wondering what we were talking about. <small>I still feel that way a bit in post.</small> I did appreciate the personable stories and language, the visual feel of the reading, and the actual photos pertaining to them, like the yoga workstation. I can appreciate that there were groundbreaking developments happening in this documentation and the human-ness of all the emotion of events happening alongside. I think these readings emphasize how deep my adhd runs (it’s a new thing, I have been accepting) but on top of that, it also feels like emphasis of how long my brain has been dormant cus i am just reading lots of words. I wonder if I share that experience with anyone. Anyway, I wonder if screen splitting refers to a similar system as a ‘screen share’ that is how i imagine it. I still don’t think i can visualize a keyset in relation to keyboard and mouse. And this mother of all demos, i don’t know that i understand what was actually being demoed here. What was the breakthrough. <cite>This seems like a nice underdog, coming of age story though … almost, lol, and that’s nice.</cite>

            <strong>I'm sure the density made it much more difficult to interact with but.. </strong>

            Did you learn anything? What settled on you about this conversation Bardini is having with us?

            I have been thinking about how user treat computer differently when the computer needs to operate differently in the past. The computers used to have chunky harwares and complicated manuals for all the opperation. Using computers requires so much knowledge before hand.
