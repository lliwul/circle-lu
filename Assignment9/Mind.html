            It actually hurts right now as I write this.

                    A  book cover inspired this. It’s a trance-like (i.e inducing) photo. Lots of Chromatic Aberration. It is spiraled and webbed, and unlike anything you (I) would imagine immediately if you thought about what a trance might be. But somehow it is too simple for you to probably agree with me on that. 
                    
                    My Mind “a void a darkness a nothingness and who wants that?” except you really are in a void and this voice that sounds familiar is somehow speaking this to you although you can’t find your way to understanding what is really going on. You just contemplate. in the silence and noise that this is the universe. it is your universe.
